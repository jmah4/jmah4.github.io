<h2> Hello!</h2>
<p> My name is Jennifer, and I am a fourth year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto. 
  My areas of study are Energy Systems and Electromagnetics, Software, and Computer Hardware and Computer Networks, 
  but I like to learn anything. Outside of school, I'm the current president of the University of Toronto Toastmaster club, 
  and I do the crossword (my dream is to compete in a U-25 crossword tournament.)</p>

<p>My work experience includes mostly open-source work, which you can find more 
  about <a href='work-experience.html'>here</a>. My most recent job was as a Software Engineering Intern at Microchip, 
  where I worked with the SmartHLS compiler group to create open-source libraries to demonstrate how to use the tool, 
  created and filed a patent for an automatic on-chip FPGA instrumentation tool, and much more.</p>

<p>I also do silly projects, which you can see <a href='projects.html'>here</a>. If you have a project idea (the s
  illier the better), shoot me a message, I'd love to collab!</p>

<p> If you have any comments, questions, complaints, hate mail, etc., you can reach me by email at jennifermah76@gmail.com.</p>

<p> P.S.: Here is my <a href="https://github.com/jmah4">personal Github</a> and here is
  my Microchip (prev internship) <a href="https://github.com/jennifermah76">Github</a>.</p>
